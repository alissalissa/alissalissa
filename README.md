- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @alissalissa
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in quantitative research in the social sciences
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m a postdoc.
- I use code to solve research problems, predominantly in R and C++, as well as for fun!
- The code posted here is stuff I feel might be helpful for others, rather than containing the full codebase of all my projects.
